## Competition and Hurdles

Hawai’i History Day is an annually recurring competition with fairs being held in different districts and schools throughout the state. Winners of the Hawai’i District Fair would advance to Nationals for an opportunity to claim special prizes and bragging rights. In 2017, the theme for History Day was ‘Taking a Stand,’ which outlined various topics surrounding influential figures that took action against oppression that they could no longer bear with. While doing research, Frederick Douglass stood out to me as I found that his life story epitomized the central message of the given theme.

## An Unexpected Surprise

One school morning, I was unexpectedly notified by my history instructor that I had won our school contest for History Day with the research paper category. Subsequently, I attended the Leeward District Fair for a chance to progress to the State competition, where I won as well. Although I was not able to advance to Nationals, this experience was memorable in that I got to encounter different hurdles and acquired knowledge with how to approach a task with increased levels of trials. For this, I was awarded the Hawai’i Nikkei Historical Editorial Board for my paper, and particularly for the extensive research work that was provided in the annotated bibliography section of the project.
