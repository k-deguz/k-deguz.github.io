## Another module, another research paper...

Middle school was a notably tumultuous chapter in my scholastic career, particularly made memorable by the enduring friends I made, the unruly groups of students in classes, weekly shenanigans at the courtyard, and the high volume of fights that occured just outside the walls of campus. Amid the thrilling chaos that each day awaited, a routine for all six of my classes was already established. Nothing came as a surprise. The instructors taught the material, others would listen while some didn't, small breakout groups would occasionally be assigned, we completed in-class exercises, homework was passed out, and the day would end. This all became part of the standard procedure. In light of this, I did not bat much of an eye when my social studies teacher provided us a task - another paper.

As per her instructions and guidance, I began to work on choosing a topic that coincided with a theme of "Taking a Stand." I became increasingly intrigued, but more so confounded on the issue of what I should write about. Cue *One Piece*. I had been a fan of the notorious Japanese manga series written by Eiichiro Oda since I was little. The story follows Luffy, a young pirate and his crew as they try to find the the One Piece - a vast treasure left behind by the Pirate King, Gold Roger. While on the high seas, the story delves into multiple instances of government oppression and historical lores of past atrocities as the protagonists visit an array of unique islands. However, [one scene](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cgDQgFlMxbw) from the anime served as an outstanding revelation for me as it related to the theme our teacher had given us. The narration and message from the episode stood out: "if you hurt somebody or if somebody hurts you, the same red blood will be shed." With this, I decided to tackle the poignant conflicts surrounding slavery during the 19th century, and with that unraveled a string of research into influential figures during this time. Frederick Douglass was my final ruling as his life became a symbolic representation of the oppressed; ultimately becoming the leading voice of the Abolitionist Movement. A few weeks later, I finished my essay and turned it in without much further thought. 

## An Unexpected Surprise and Enlightening Experience

*Hawai’i History Day is an annually recurring competition with fairs being held in different districts and schools throughout the state. Winners of the Hawai’i District Fair would advance to Nationals for an opportunity to claim special cash prizes and scholarships.*

One school morning, I was unexpectedly notified by my social studies teacher that she had enjoyed my paper and eventually submitted it as an entry to our school's History Day competition. She alarmingly told me that my paper had been chosen as the winning submission in the school contest with the research paper category. Subsequently, I attended the Leeward District Fair for a chance to progress to the State competition, where I won as well. Although, that was ultimately where the tour would end. Though, I wasn't able to advance to Nationals, this experience was memorable in that I got to encounter different hurdles and acquired knowledge with how to approach a task with increased levels of trials. For this, I was awarded the Hawai’i Nikkei Historical Editorial Board for my paper, and particularly for the extensive research work that was provided in the annotated bibliography section of the project. Research into Doughlass and his life, as well as the competition taught me the importance of dedication and personal reflection during each stage of the process. I wanted to win, but the blend of hurdles throughout the entire research process and competition gave me encounters that were just as valuable as winning the entire way through.
