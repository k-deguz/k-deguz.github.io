### Project Overview
Toaster Eats was a team effort of contributions between myself and four other members within our ICS 314 class at UH MƒÅnoa. The web application was designed to solve the issue of preoccupied college students having no viable platform to find creative recipes that fulfill their lack of resources with time, kitchen resources, cooking skills and access to grocery stores. With this, we aimed to create a functional site for users to discover new recipes or add them, along with finding ingredients and the vendors that sell them.
