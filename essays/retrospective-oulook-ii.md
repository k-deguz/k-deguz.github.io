#### A Fresh Perspective
My final semester at the University of Hawaii at MƒÅnoa has ended. Though busy, stressful, and overwhelming, the general takeaways I had during this time felt gratifying and exhilarating. It provided me valuable experiences and insights into real-world applications, along with the capabilities needed for a software developer in a professional setting. Along the way, taking ICS 414 was instrumental in continuing my knowledge expansion into the skills needed for improving and having better software engineering practices.

The opportunity to work on a project for Spire Hawaii LLP as a client and having the semester dedicated to developing a platform for their business was a pleasantly eye-opening experience. Although I've had previous experiences with project milestones from the past, having customer-focused ones where we present our progress and the features our team had implemented up to that point to them was new to me. Having this foundational process cemented into our project window offered an aspect that I initially anticipated but eventually overlooked. Altogether, this gave me a glimpse into potential future endeavors where other industry positions require this same management procedure. It emphasized the significance of meeting deadlines and finishing different aspects of the project by coordinating with team members to make sure that everything is in order. This involves making sure that responsibilities have been properly assigned, members are equally contributing, and tasks being complete.

#### Project Management
Learning established project management methodologies helped our team get the issues we needed to tackle in order. For one, using GitHub projects as our team's Kanban Board for Issue Driven Project Management (IDPM) and having weekly code reviews for our project components was immensely useful. It led us to ensuring our project had features functioning properly and as intended. Similar to my experience from ICS 314, our team used an Agile Project Management methodology to ensure that our workflow was efficient and that our tasks were delivered on time for milestones.

A new branch was created for each unique issue or feature that we planned to implement into our project to ensure that there would be no merge conflicts or underlying problems with design. The code reviews also allowed for us to be our feedback loop to catch any complications for debugging, analyzing coding standards, and seeing what could be improved. Moreover, the customer milestone meetings for showcasing our project demos provided us with real-time feedback to re-prioritize our backlog of issues. Ultimately, I found that the demos were vastly helpful as it allowed us to adapt and plan ahead for our responsibilities to align with what the client wants.

#### An Invaluable Learning Experience
Our work for the course, project, learnings, challenges, and the semester as a whole solidified what capabilities I acquired from previous classes. Going from learning essential programming language logic and using UI frameworks to create web applications to working on developing a platform for a client was a hugely beneficial experience. 

Creating features for client-driven milestones taught me the importance of having clear communication, disciplined planning and collaborative code reviews. Additionally, having the project demos for client feedback gave me experience into what the industry is looking for from professionals within a real-world environment. Overall, this course and the semester gave me a concrete framework for balancing timeliness, efficiency, client satisfaction and having project discipline to better equip me in tackling future challenge in software development.
